<h2>Music</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I have played lead guitar in a band since January, and I have loved it. There is truly no feeling like ripping a guitar solo in front of 300 people; but it is also incredibly nerve-wracking. I play in a band under the name "Dawson Wayne", and I have performed with them in venues such as Velour (Provo), the Boardwalk (Orem), and Broadway Lofts (Salt Lake City).</li>
    <li>My goal is to start my own band this fall.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I love running! I first got into running in high school, when I ran sprints in track and field. On my church mission in Europe, I got into long-distance running--this was around the time that I set the goal to run a marathon around a year after I got home. 4/20/24 marked 9 months since I had come home, and I ran the Salt Lake City Marathon! I finished with a time of 4:17.</li>
    <li>My goal is to run the St. George Marathon in October, and to bring my time down to 3:45. I'm going to do this by including more runs that range from 22-24 miles, and implement better recoveries.</li>
    <li>I am fascinated by the Boston Marathon--I would like to attend someday. Click the link below to learn more about finishing times in the 2023 Boston Marathon.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Service</h2>
<ul>
    <li>My most meaningful service opportunity was my two-year mission for my church in the Netherlands. While I was there, I gained fluency in Dutch, taught people how they can come closer to God, and ate lots of Dutch stroopwafels.</li>
    <li>My goal is to work with the Special Olympics this summer as a partner-athlete. As a partner-athlete, I will assist individuals with special needs in activities such as soccer, basketball, and running.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals & Ambitions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I have plans to apply to the Finance program at Brigham Young University, where I am a current undergrad student. I will also do the Healthcare Leadership minor.</li>
    <li>I will start my career in hospital administration. I am going to work my way up to hospital president. I would especially like to be the president of a non-profit children's hospital if opportunity allows. Eventually, I would like to start my own skilled nursing home.</li>
    <li>I will run a marathon in 3:30.</li>
    <li>Most importantly, I will get married and have a family. I would like to settle in Idaho in the Boise area.</li>
</ul>
